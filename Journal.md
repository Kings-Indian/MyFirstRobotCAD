# May 10th: Base Structure and Hardware Selection

I created a fundamental base structure and experimented with dimensions to find optimal tolerances. I also found some hardware.

# May 11th: Component Creation

Created the following components:
- Gears
- Wheels
- Motor Enclosure
- Motor Negative Model (a representation of the motor)

Main challenges included:
- Motor interference with other parts
- Maintaining appropriate tolerances
- Accurately modeling the negative motor model

# May 11th: Printer Setup and Troubleshooting

I installed Klipper and Mainsail on my Raspberry Pi and created a printer.cfg file. I've been working on this for days with almost no progress, but my progress stopped after 1.5 hrs. But still haven't fixed it (even tried it a month ago), so I'm just using Marlin for nowâ€”I give up until I feel ready to retry.

# May 13th: Circuit Planning and Fastener Creation

I planned out my circuits for my ESP32 and created fastener screws. I also chose my hardware for drivetrain fastening and separated the drivetrain into Tank modules and the normal drivetrain.

# May 13th: Robot Completion (Except Battery)

I completed the entirety of the robot (besides some light cleanups), excluding the battery, which will be included after testing.

# May 13th: Surface Smoothing and Animation

- Smoothed all surfaces and verified they are manifold.
- Ensured all parts are non-intersecting.
- Added additional supports for the motors.
- Animated the entire assembly with proper relational movement.

# May 16th: Battery Modeling and Mount Implementation

I modeled my battery and began implementing its mount. I went through multiple designs before landing on the final one.

# May 17th: Battery Mount and Tank Drive Modules Completed

I finished the battery mount and recreated the tank drive modules. This also required me to create an extra set of "negative" screw hole sets. I recreated the Tank drive geometry in order to allow for the center of rotations to be further apart while still allowing for multiple modules. This allows a higher radius, providing more space under the robot. As a result, less space needs to be extruded from the drivetrain, making for a more stable base while still maintaining enough thickness for stability.

# June 4th: Updated Everything to Github

I added everything to Github, previously it was all elseware. 

**Total time spent: 4h (On-Call)**
