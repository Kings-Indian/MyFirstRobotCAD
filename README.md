# MyFirstRobotCAD
CAD and Modeling of an ESP32-controlled tank-drive car|


# What is this (Overview)
This is a mini car, that uses a 9.6V NI-MH Rechargeable Battery Pack, ESP32, 2 TT motors, an L298N Driver, and a 3D printed body.

# Why use this (over XRP Robots?)
I made this project as I found XRP's to be very expensive, at $115. While this is justified for some FIRST Robotics teams who use it as coding practice, as a drivetrain focused on beginners, I believe this is unnessesary. The XRP featuring a no-tools, no-soldering assembly process and a suite of components including a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), motor drivers, and various sensors. The inclusion of the Raspberry Pi Pico W enables wireless connectivity and compatibility with a range of programming environments, from block-based coding for novices to Python and Arduino for more advanced users. However, for the typical beginner or hobbyist interested mainly in hands-on mechanical learning and straightforward driving tasks, such advanced features are often unnecessary. Most entry-level users are not leveraging WPILib or practicing the development of precise autonomous routines, which are more relevant to competitive robotics teams. This project is a much cheaper, easier to reproduce version of the XRP that can be expanded still.
